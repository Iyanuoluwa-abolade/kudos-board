### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics prepared me to complete the assignment. The feautures I felt unprepared to complete was user authentication and connecting the cards to the database

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have done the login , sign up, and user authentication

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
* 
  In my project demo, I was able to understand how to connect my frontend to my backend, create boards, make my filter buttons work, and create new boards. However, I had issue with connecting my cards to my database but was able to resolve it.
